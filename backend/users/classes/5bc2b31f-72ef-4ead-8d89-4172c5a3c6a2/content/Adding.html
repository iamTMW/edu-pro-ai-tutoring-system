    <h2>Module 1: Addition</h2>

    <div>
        <p><strong>Addition means putting things together to find out how many we have in total.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>What Addition Means</h3>
        <p>If you have some things and then get more, addition helps us find out the new amount.</p>
        <p>We show addition with the + sign.</p>
        <p>We show the answer with the = sign.</p>
        <p><strong>Example idea:</strong> If you have 4 apples and get 3 more, you put them together to get 7 apples.</p>
    </div>

        <h3>How to Think About Addition</h3>
        <p>We can add by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Counting up (start at one number and hop forward)</li>
            <li>Using our fingers</li>
            <li>Using a number line</li>
            <li>Using objects (like blocks, stickers, cubes)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Tens and Ones Reminder</h3>
        <p>Some numbers have tens (like 20, 30, 40) and ones (like 1, 2, 3).</p>
        <p>When we add, we usually add the ones first, then the tens.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Why Addition Is Important</h3>
        <p>We use addition all the time:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Counting toys</li>
            <li>Adding time</li>
            <li>Counting money</li>
            <li>Playing games</li>
            <li>Sharing snacks</li>
        </ul>
