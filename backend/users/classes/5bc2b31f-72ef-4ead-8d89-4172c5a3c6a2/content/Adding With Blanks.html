    <h2>Module 2: Adding with Blanks</h2>

    <div>
        <p><strong>Adding with blanks helps us find a missing number in an addition problem.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>What Adding with Blanks Means</h3>
        <p>Sometimes we know some numbers but not all. We use a blank (like __ or ?) for the missing number.</p>
        <p>We solve it by finding the number that makes the addition true.</p>
        <p><strong>Example idea:</strong> 4 + __ = 7. The missing number is 3.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>How to Solve Blanks</h3>
        <p>We can solve blanks by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Counting up from the known number</li>
            <li>Using our fingers to add up</li>
            <li>Using a number line to hop forward</li>
            <li>Using objects (like blocks or cubes) to see how many are needed</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Tens and Ones Reminder</h3>
        <p>When numbers have tens and ones, we usually find the missing ones first, then tens.</p>
    </div>
