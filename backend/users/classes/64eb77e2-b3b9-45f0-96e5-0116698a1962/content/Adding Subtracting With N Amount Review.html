    <h2>Module 6: Review of Adding and Subtracting with N Amounts</h2>

    <div>
        <p><strong>This review covers key concepts for addition and subtraction with multiple numbers (N amounts).</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Adding with N Amounts: Key Points</h3>
        <p><strong>Adding with N amounts means putting together more than two numbers to find the total.</strong></p>
        <p>Sometimes we add three, four, or more numbers together.</p>
        <p>We can also have a missing number represented by a blank (like __) to solve for.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> 1 + 2 + 3 + __ = 10. The missing number is 4.</p>
        <p>How to solve:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the known numbers first</li>
            <li>Use counting objects (blocks, cubes, stickers) for each number</li>
            <li>Use a number line to hop forward step by step</li>
            <li>Check if the total matches the number on the right side of the equation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tens and Ones Reminder:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the ones first, then the tens to get the total</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why it’s important:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Work with bigger numbers</li>
            <li>Understand addition patterns</li>
            <li>Solve problems with multiple steps</li>
            <li>Prepare for subtraction, multiplication, and more advanced math</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Subtracting with N Amounts: Key Points</h3>
        <p><strong>Subtracting with N amounts means taking away several numbers in a sequence and finding the total or missing number.</strong></p>
        <p>Sometimes we subtract more than two numbers in a row.</p>
        <p>We can also have a missing number represented by a blank (like __) to solve for.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> __ - 5 - 3 = 2. The missing number is 10.</p>
        <p>How to solve:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start with the known numbers and work backward to find the missing number</li>
            <li>Subtract step by step from left to right</li>
            <li>Use objects or drawings to represent each subtraction</li>
            <li>Use a number line to move backward in steps</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tens and Ones Reminder:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Subtract the ones first, then the tens</li>
            <li>Sometimes “borrow” is needed to make subtraction work correctly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why it’s important:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Work with bigger numbers and sequences</li>
            <li>Understand subtraction patterns</li>
            <li>Solve multi-step problems</li>
            <li>Prepare for more advanced math like multiplication and division</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tips for N-Amount Problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Break the problem into smaller steps and solve one number at a time</li>
            <li>Visualize numbers with objects or drawings</li>
            <li>Check your answer by reversing the operation (addition ↔ subtraction)</li>
            <li>Practice with blanks to improve problem-solving confidence</li>
            <li>Always handle tens and ones carefully to avoid mistakes</li>
        </ul>
