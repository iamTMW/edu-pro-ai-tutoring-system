    <h2>Module 3: Adding with N Amounts</h2>

    <div>
        <p><strong>Adding with N amounts means putting together more than two numbers to find the total.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>What Adding with N Amounts Means</h3>
        <p>Sometimes we add three, four, or more numbers together.</p>
        <p>We can also have a missing number represented by a blank (like __) to solve for.</p>
        <p><strong>Example idea:</strong> 1 + 2 + 3 + __ = 10. The missing number is 4.</p>
    </div>

        <h3>How to Solve N-Amount Addition</h3>
        <p>We can solve by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Adding the known numbers first</li>
            <li>Using counting objects (blocks, cubes, or stickers) for each number</li>
            <li>Using a number line to hop forward step by step</li>
            <li>Checking if the total matches the number on the right side of the equation</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Tens and Ones Reminder</h3>
        <p>When numbers have tens and ones, add the ones first, then add the tens to get the total.</p>
    </div>

        <h3>Why Adding with N Amounts Is Important</h3>
        <p>It helps us:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Work with bigger numbers</li>
            <li>Understand addition patterns</li>
            <li>Solve problems with multiple steps</li>
            <li>Prepare for subtraction, multiplication, and more advanced math</li>
        </ul>
