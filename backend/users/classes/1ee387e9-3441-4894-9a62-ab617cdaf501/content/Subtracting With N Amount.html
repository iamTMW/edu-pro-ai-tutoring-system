    <h2>Module 4: Subtracting with N Amounts</h2>

    <div>
        <p><strong>Subtracting with N amounts means taking away several numbers in a sequence and finding the total or missing number.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>What Subtracting with N Amounts Means</h3>
        <p>Sometimes we subtract more than two numbers in a row.</p>
        <p>We can also have a missing number represented by a blank (like __) to solve for.</p>
        <p><strong>Example idea:</strong> __ - 5 - 3 = 2. The missing number is 10.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>How to Solve N-Amount Subtraction</h3>
        <p>We can solve by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Starting with the known numbers and working backward to find the missing number</li>
            <li>Subtracting step by step from left to right</li>
            <li>Using objects or drawings to represent each subtraction</li>
            <li>Using a number line to move backward in steps</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Tens and Ones Reminder</h3>
        <p>When numbers have tens and ones, subtract the ones first, then the tens.</p>
        <p>Sometimes we need to “borrow” to make subtraction work correctly.</p>
    </div>

        <h3>Why Subtracting with N Amounts Is Important</h3>
        <p>It helps us:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Work with bigger numbers and sequences</li>
            <li>Understand subtraction patterns</li>
            <li>Solve multi-step problems</li>
            <li>Prepare for more advanced math like multiplication and division</li>
        </ul>
