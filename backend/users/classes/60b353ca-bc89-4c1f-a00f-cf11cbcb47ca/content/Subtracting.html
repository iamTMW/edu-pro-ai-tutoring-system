    <h2>Module 2: Subtraction</h2>

    <div>
        <p><strong>Subtraction means taking away or finding how many are left.</strong></p>
    </div>

        <h3>What Subtraction Means</h3>
        <p>If you have something and you use some, lose some, or give some away, subtraction helps us find how many remain.</p>
        <p>We show subtraction with the – sign.</p>
        <p><strong>Example idea:</strong> If I have 10 cookies and I eat 3, subtraction helps me find how many cookies are left, which are 7 cookies left.</p>

        <h3>How to Think About Subtraction</h3>
        <p>We can subtract by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Counting backwards</li>
            <li>Using a number line</li>
            <li>Taking away physical objects</li>
            <li>Thinking in terms of “How many left?”</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Tens and Ones in Subtraction</h3>
        <p>Sometimes we need to “borrow” when subtracting.</p>
        <p>We focus on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Taking away ones from ones</li>
            <li>Taking away tens from tens</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Why Subtraction Is Important</h3>
        <p>We use subtraction to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Count how much is left</li>
            <li>Compare two amounts</li>
            <li>Figure out differences</li>
            <li>Solve everyday problems</li>
        </ul>
