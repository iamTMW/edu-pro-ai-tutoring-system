    <h2>Module 3: Subtracting with Blanks</h2>

    <div>
        <p><strong>Subtracting with blanks helps us find the missing number in a subtraction problem.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>What Subtracting with Blanks Means</h3>
        <p>Sometimes we know some numbers but not all. We use a blank (like __ or ?) for the missing number.</p>
        <p>We solve it by finding the number that makes the subtraction true.</p>
        <p><strong>Example idea:</strong> __ - 3 = 7. The missing number is 10.</p>
    </div>

        <h3>How to Solve Subtraction Blanks</h3>
        <p>We can solve blanks by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thinking “How many do I need to start with to subtract and get this number?”</li>
            <li>Using counting backwards</li>
            <li>Using objects (blocks, cubes, stickers) to see how many are left</li>
            <li>Using a number line to hop backward</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Tens and Ones Reminder</h3>
        <p>When numbers have tens and ones, we usually find the missing ones first, then tens.</p>
        <p>Sometimes we need to “borrow” to make subtraction work.</p>
