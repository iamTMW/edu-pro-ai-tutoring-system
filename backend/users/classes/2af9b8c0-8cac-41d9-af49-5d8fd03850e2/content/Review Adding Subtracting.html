        <p><strong>This review covers the key ideas and important tips for addition and subtraction.</strong></p>
    </div>

        <h3>Addition: Key Points</h3>
        <p><strong>Addition means putting things together to find out how many we have in total.</strong></p>
        <p>If you have some things and then get more, addition helps us find out the new amount.</p>
        <p>We show addition with the + sign and the answer with =.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you have 4 apples and get 3 more, you have 7 apples.</p>
        <p>Ways to add:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Counting up (start at one number and hop forward)</li>
            <li>Using fingers</li>
            <li>Using a number line</li>
            <li>Using objects (blocks, stickers, cubes)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tens and Ones Reminder:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some numbers have tens (20, 30, 40) and ones (1, 2, 3).</li>
            <li>Add the ones first, then the tens.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why addition is important:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Counting toys</li>
            <li>Adding time</li>
            <li>Counting money</li>
            <li>Playing games</li>
            <li>Sharing snacks</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Subtraction: Key Points</h3>
        <p><strong>Subtraction means taking away or finding how many are left.</strong></p>
        <p>If you have something and you use, lose, or give some away, subtraction helps us find how many remain.</p>
        <p>We show subtraction with the – sign.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If I have 10 cookies and I eat 3, I have 7 cookies left.</p>
        <p>Ways to subtract:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Counting backwards</li>
            <li>Using a number line</li>
            <li>Taking away physical objects</li>
            <li>Thinking in terms of “How many left?”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tens and Ones Reminder:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sometimes we need to “borrow” when subtracting.</li>
            <li>Take away ones from ones, then tens from tens.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why subtraction is important:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Counting how much is left</li>
            <li>Comparing amounts</li>
            <li>Figuring out differences</li>
            <li>Solving everyday problems</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tips for Both Addition and Subtraction</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand the problem before starting.</li>
            <li>Use objects or drawings to visualize numbers.</li>
            <li>Check answers using the inverse operation (addition ↔ subtraction).</li>
            <li>Practice with blanks and multiple numbers to build confidence.</li>
            <li>Break big numbers into tens and ones to simplify calculations.</li>
        </ul>
