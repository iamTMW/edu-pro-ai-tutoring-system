    <h2>Module 5: Review of Adding and Subtracting with Blanks</h2>

    <div>
        <p><strong>This review covers the key ideas for solving addition and subtraction problems with missing numbers (blanks).</strong></p>

        <h3>Adding with Blanks: Key Points</h3>
        <p><strong>Adding with blanks helps us find a missing number in an addition problem.</strong></p>
        <p>Sometimes we know some numbers but not all. We use a blank (like __ or ?) for the missing number.</p>
        <p>We solve it by finding the number that makes the addition true.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> 4 + __ = 7. The missing number is 3.</p>
        <p>How to solve:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Counting up from the known number</li>
            <li>Using fingers to add up</li>
            <li>Using a number line to hop forward</li>
            <li>Using objects (blocks or cubes) to see how many are needed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tens and Ones Reminder:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Find the missing ones first, then the tens</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why it’s important:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check our answers</li>
            <li>Understand how numbers work together</li>
            <li>Solve puzzles and games</li>
            <li>Prepare for more difficult addition and subtraction</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Subtracting with Blanks: Key Points</h3>
        <p><strong>Subtracting with blanks helps us find the missing number in a subtraction problem.</strong></p>
        <p>Sometimes we know some numbers but not all. We use a blank (like __ or ?) for the missing number.</p>
        <p>We solve it by finding the number that makes the subtraction true.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> __ - 3 = 7. The missing number is 10.</p>
        <p>How to solve:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Think “How many do I need to start with to subtract and get this number?”</li>
            <li>Use counting backwards</li>
            <li>Use objects (blocks, cubes, stickers) to see how many are left</li>
            <li>Use a number line to hop backward</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tens and Ones Reminder:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Find the missing ones first, then the tens</li>
            <li>Sometimes borrowing is needed to make subtraction work</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why it’s important:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check our answers</li>
            <li>Understand how subtraction works</li>
            <li>Solve puzzles and problems</li>
            <li>Prepare for more advanced math</li>

        <h3>Tips for Solving Blanks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Break problems into smaller steps and solve one part at a time</li>
            <li>Visualize numbers with objects or drawings</li>
            <li>Check your answer using the opposite operation (addition ↔ subtraction)</li>
            <li>Practice with multiple blanks to improve confidence</li>
            <li>Pay attention to tens and ones to avoid mistakes</li>
        </ul>
